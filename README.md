# Multi-Task Learning on BERT for Biomedical Text Mining

This repository provides codes and models of the Multi-Task Learning on BERT for Biomedical Text Mining. 
The package is based on [`mt-dnn`](https://github.com/namisan/mt-dnn).

## Pre-trained models

The pre-trained MT-BlueBERT weights, vocab, and config files can be downloaded from:

*

The benchmark datasets can be downloaded from [https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark)

## Quick start

### Setup Environment
1. python3.6
2. install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download data
Please refer to download BLUE_Benchmark: https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark


### Preprocess data
```bash
bash ncbi_scripts/blue_prepro.sh
```

### Train a MT-DNN model
```bash
bash ncbi_scripts/run_blue_mt_dnn.sh
```

### Fine-tune a model
```bash
bash ncbi_scripts/run_blue_fine_tune.sh
```

### Convert Tensorflow BERT model to the MT-DNN format
```bash
python ncbi_scripts/convert_tf_to_pt.py --tf_checkpoint_root $SRC_ROOT --pytorch_checkpoint_path $DEST --encoder_type 1```
```
